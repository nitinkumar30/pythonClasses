> So today was our first class where we've only learned about some Introduction about Python and it's characteristics.

> Following are the characteristics of Python:
> * Python is an interpreted
> * object-oriented,
> * high-level
> * programming language with dynamic semantics.
> * Its built in data structures, combined with
> * dynamic typing and
> * dynamic binding
> * use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
> * Python's simple,
> * easy to learn syntax
> * emphasizes readability
> * reduces the cost of program maintenance.
> * supports modules and packages, which
> * encourages program modularity and
> * code reuse
> * can be freely distributed.

> As told, it is open source, it's official documentation can be found in [Python Documentation](https://www.python.org/).

> We can run our Python code online also. Following are some of the Online Python Interpreters:
> * [IDEone](https://ideone.com/l/python)
> * [Programmiz Python interpreter](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)
