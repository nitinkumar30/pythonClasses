# RULES TO CREATE A VARIABLE:
# -  Should start with letter or underscore only
# - Can't begin with a number
# - Can only contain alpha numeric characters
# - Case sensitive

# Numbers can be in middle or at the end of a variable name
n123 = 123

# But cannot be at the beggining
# 123n = 123

# Apart from underscore, special characters also cannot be used
n123_67NITIN90 = "Nitin KUMAr"
# n123-67NITIN90 = "Yash Kumar"

# print(n123_67NITIN90)
# print(n123_67nitin90)

# We can also reassign values to same variable
x = 2
x = 5
print(x)

# TYPES OF CASES WE USE DURING NAMING THE VARIABLES
# Camelcase
myVariableName = "Nitin Kumar"

# Pascal case
MyVariableName = "Yash Kumar"

# Snake case
my_variable_name = "Ujjwal Kumar"
